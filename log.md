# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Friday, January 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the shoppies awards page and got most of the basic markup done along with a start into the styling.

**Thoughts:** 
This app screams to be made as a react application but i want to give it a go making it in Pure HTML, CSS and Javascript(Thats right not even Jquery but dont hold me to that). Since its been a while that ive worked with just the basics there was a little bit of googling involved but after an hour and a half of work im pretty happy where its at. Tomorrow I hope to get a few more hours in and begin working on the interactive elements once everything is styled up.

**Sucesses:**
  Starting with basic html ccss and akavascript reminded me of how much I still have to learn to write good code. I did learn several new VScode key Shortcuts now that im not trying to folow an instructior or tutorial. 
**Failures:**
  I seem to have forgotten exactly how flexbox works. It took a bit of stepping away and going back to look at it before things became clear again and i was able to press forward. However, this also led me down several rabbitholes that I definetly did not intend to get stuck in. I have to work on not getting easily distracted.

### Day 1: Saturday, January 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on the styling of the page and immedieatly began refactoring the CSS into a more concise and readable format. 

**Thoughts:** 
The styling is where I want it, for now anyways. I'm happy to have gotten through it since ive always struggled with CSS. It's by far my least favortie part of development which is part of the reason I'm forcing myself to not use a framework and instead style each piece individually. To that end I've started building myself a little personal frameworkfor this project that I may take an make a standard template for myself for future projects. I definetly need some more work using pseudo classes but thats something I'll tackle when I have the Basic JS implemented.

**Sucesses:**
Finished most of the basic styling relatively quickly and managed to get a good way into refactoring whats there. Focus was significantly better today and the rabbit holes I ended up going down were all related to the topic I was looking into so it wasn't time wasted. 

**Failures:**
Still spent far too much time going through and looking up the different CSS rules. It took longer than it should have to get my head wrapped around some of the concepts but hopefuly thats an issue I'll get better at over time.

### Day 2: Sunday, Januard 3rd 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished refactoring CSS, Added some interation effects, and wrote the basic call to the OMDB API and got a successful response.

**Thoughts** 
I need to go back and tweak the CSS and add some other options but everything is in a good place for now. Eventually I'll have the page significantly more interactive than simply just being able to search but baby steps for right now. CSS is becoming easier and I felt much more comfortable working with it today. Instead of wrestling with it it felt like it was cooperating for once which is a really good feeling. This is my first time using fetch and it was significantly easier to use than I had thought it would be. The plus side of that being that tomorrows work should be siginificantly easier and quicker to do than I originally had planned for. 

**Sucesses:**
Was able to finish CSS quicker than originally planned and go be able to get an API response using fetch() instead of AJAX. It puts me a few hours ahead of where I had planned on being which means ive got more time to work on the bug fixing and/or adding other functionality.

**Failures:**
Only Able to work on the project for an hour today. Ideally I'd have prefered to work another 3-4 hours like yesterday.
