# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Friday, January 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the shoppies awards page and got most of the basic markup done along with a start into the styling.

**Thoughts:** 
This app screams to be made as a react application but i want to give it a go making it in Pure HTML, CSS and Javascript(Thats right not even Jquery but dont hold me to that). Since its been a while that ive worked with just the basics there was a little bit of googling involved but after an hour and a half of work im pretty happy where its at. Tomorrow I hope to get a few more hours in and begin working on the interactive elements once everything is styled up.

**Sucesses:**
  Starting with basic html ccss and akavascript reminded me of how much I still have to learn to write good code. I did learn several new VScode key Shortcuts now that im not trying to folow an instructior or tutorial. 
**Failures:**
  I seem to have forgotten exactly how flexbox works. It took a bit of stepping away and going back to look at it before things became clear again and i was able to press forward. However, this also led me down several rabbitholes that I definetly did not intend to get stuck in. I have to work on not getting easily distracted.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
