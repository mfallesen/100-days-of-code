# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Friday, January 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the shoppies awards page and got most of the basic markup done along with a start into the styling.

**Thoughts:** 
This app screams to be made as a react application but i want to give it a go making it in Pure HTML, CSS and Javascript(Thats right not even Jquery but dont hold me to that). Since its been a while that ive worked with just the basics there was a little bit of googling involved but after an hour and a half of work im pretty happy where its at. Tomorrow I hope to get a few more hours in and begin working on the interactive elements once everything is styled up.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
